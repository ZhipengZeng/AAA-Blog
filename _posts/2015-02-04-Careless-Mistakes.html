<h2>Stop making careless mistakes!!!</h2>
<p>Tonight I spent more than half an hour on adding a random function to my blog banner images with javascript (thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527803/generating-random-numbers-in-javascript-in-a-specific-range">Ionu»õ G. Stan</a> providing a method).
<br />I just kept making some tiny mistakes in spelling, addressing, construcing.
<br />It was a stupid problem even though being a beginner.
<br /><strong>Focus Focus Focus!</strong></p>
<p>a screenshot to remind myself.</p>
